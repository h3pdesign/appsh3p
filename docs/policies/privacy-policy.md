# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: February 24, 2026_

This Privacy Policy explains how data is handled on https://apps-h3p.com.

## 1. Data collection

This documentation site is designed to minimize data collection.

- No user account is required.
- No first-party advertising trackers are intentionally installed.
- No payment data is processed directly on this site.

For h3p apps listed on this site (including Metrics Data, Neon Vision Editor, Release Assistant, and X-Newsbook), data handling may vary by app features and platform integration. Where app-specific behavior exists, it is documented in the relevant app documentation and in linked third-party provider policies.

## 2. Technical logs

Hosting providers and CDNs may process technical request data (for example IP address, user agent, timestamps, requested URL) for security, delivery, and reliability.

## 3. Cookies and local storage

The site uses limited local browser storage for UI preferences (for example visual effect toggle) and may use cookies required by hosting or third-party embedded services.

See [EU Cookie Notice](/policies/eu-cookie-notice).

## 4. Third-party services

Outbound links to services such as GitHub, Apple App Store, TestFlight, Patreon, and social platforms are governed by those services' own privacy policies.

Some h3p apps may integrate with third-party services chosen by the user (for example analytics providers, source-code hosting, or distribution platforms). In those cases, third-party privacy terms apply to data processed by those integrations.

## 5. Data retention

Where technical logs are processed by infrastructure providers, retention is controlled by those providers and their security policies.

## 6. Your rights (EU/EEA)

If applicable, you may request access, correction, deletion, restriction, objection, and portability rights under GDPR, subject to legal limitations.

## 7. Contact

For privacy requests, use [Support and Feedback](/support/support-and-feedback).
