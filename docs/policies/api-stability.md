# API Stability Policy

Use this policy if your app exposes APIs or automation hooks.

## Stability levels

- Experimental: can change anytime
- Beta: may change between minor versions
- Stable: breaking changes only in major versions

## Deprecation policy

- Mark deprecated items in docs immediately.
- Keep deprecated behavior for at least one minor release unless security requires removal.
