## Application Purpose

Image Sorter is a macOS image-ingestion and organization app. Its purpose is to help users review dropped image batches, classify them into consistent categories, and process them into structured output folders with optional companion-server sync.

Primary user outcomes:

- ingest image files quickly through drag and drop
- review, rename, and categorize files before processing
- apply duplicate handling and output folder rules consistently
- monitor queue and diagnostics during processing
