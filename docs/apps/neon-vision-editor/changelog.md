# Neon Vision Editor Changelog

_Source: GitHub Releases for [Neon Vision Editor](https://github.com/h3pdesign/Neon-Vision-Editor). Last synced on February 25, 2026._

## v0.4.31 (published February 25, 2026)

Release link: [GitHub Release v0.4.31](https://github.com/h3pdesign/Neon-Vision-Editor/releases/tag/v0.4.31)

- Added an AI Activity Log on macOS with a dedicated diagnostics window and menu entry to inspect startup/provider events.
- Added centralized macOS app command wiring for settings, AI diagnostics, updater, editor actions, and window-level command routing.
- Added a full Flux/command-pattern redesign completed in a parallel session.
- Improved release automation resiliency in `scripts/release_all.sh` with fail-fast `gh` auth checks, workflow/runner prechecks, stricter workflow status handling, and retryable asset verification.
- Improved settings startup behavior to preserve user-selected tabs/preferences and avoid redundant refresh work when opening Settings.
- Improved Settings responsiveness by moving font discovery off the main thread and reducing unnecessary window configurator reapplication churn.
- Improved Swift 6 readiness with a full concurrency hardening audit completed beyond this patch scope.
- Fixed startup preference regressions that previously re-disabled completion and other editor behaviors on every launch.
- Fixed settings invocation edge cases on macOS by removing duplicate keyboard interception and avoiding double signaling when system Settings handling succeeds.
- Fixed release flow false-success scenarios by requiring notarized workflow success (`gh run watch --exit-status`) and surfacing failed-job logs immediately.

Release link: [GitHub Release v0.4.22](https://github.com/h3pdesign/Neon-Vision-Editor/releases/tag/v0.4.22)

- Added shared syntax-regex compilation cache across highlight passes on macOS and iOS.
- Improved large-document responsiveness by avoiding full regex reprocessing on caret-only moves.
- Improved iOS line-number gutter performance by caching line-count driven rendering paths.

- Added curated popular themes including Dracula, One Dark Pro, Nord, Tokyo Night, and Gruvbox.
- Improved direct-distribution updater flow with in-app download, verification, and staged install.
