Release link: [GitHub Release v0.4.32](https://github.com/h3pdesign/Neon-Vision-Editor/releases/tag/v0.4.32)

- Added native macOS `SettingsLink` wiring for the menu bar entry so it opens the Settings scene through the system path.
- Improved macOS command integration by preserving the system app-settings command group and standard Settings routing behavior.
- Improved project-folder last-session restoration reliability by keeping security-scoped folder access active before rebuilding the sidebar tree.
- Fixed non-standard Settings shortcut mapping by restoring the macOS standard `Cmd+,` behavior.
- Fixed startup behavior when "Open with Blank Document" is enabled so launch always opens exactly one empty document.
