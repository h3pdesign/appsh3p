# Neon Vision Editor Launch Story

Introducing Neon Vision Editor.

After building, breaking, refactoring, redesigning, and fixing edge cases late at night, Neon Vision Editor shipped across all Apple platforms.

## What Shipped

- Neon Vision Editor for macOS, iPadOS, and iOS
- Unified design language and behavior across all devices
- Native performance and interface quality

## Why All Apple Platforms

Context switching is real.

- Start on Mac.
- Continue on iPad.
- Edit on iPhone.

The goal was one coherent product feel, not three disconnected UX systems.

## What Makes It Different

Neon Vision Editor is fully native, not a wrapped cross-platform shell.

That enables:

- fast launch
- smooth scrolling
- real macOS and iOS behavior
- proper dark and light mode support
- clean typography

Visual design includes subtle neon accents with controlled contrast.

## AI Philosophy

AI is included for practical assistance like lightweight code completion.

It does not try to replace your thinking, generate endless fluff, or interrupt your workflow.

The goal is assistant behavior, not content-factory behavior.

## Open Development

- [GitHub](https://github.com/h3pdesign/Neon-Vision-Editor)
- [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/YWB2fGAP)
- [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/neon-vision-editor/id6758950965)

If you are into native Apple platform development, the source code is openly visible.

## Feedback

Critical feedback is welcome.

Shipping software is iterative. Quality improves fastest when real users push on real edge cases.
