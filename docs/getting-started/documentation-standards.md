# Documentation Standards

Use the same structure across every app page:

1. What the feature does.
2. Why and when to use it.
3. Platform/version requirements.
4. Example usage.
5. Known limitations.
6. Troubleshooting.

## Writing style

- keep paragraphs short
- prefer examples over theory
- include concrete version numbers when relevant
- avoid marketing language in technical docs
